                            <p><strong>This is the first part in a six-part series on the Five Solas of Protestantism.</strong></p>
                            <p>Sola, the word flows off your tongue like butter. Soli Deo Gloria, it sounds so melodious. You might be wondering, but what do these phrases mean, and what does it have to do with me and my faith? Let's find out together.</p>
                            <p>The word <em>sola</em> means “alone” or “only”, these words and phrases are Latin, which is very appropriate for the era where they come from, that is, the 14/15<sup>th</sup> century European Reformation, the language they all spoke and taught in was Latin. And it was the Reformers who spoke this language that articulated these five basic beliefs in the Bible.</p>
                            <p>It was Martin Luther, John Calvin, Ulrich Zwingli, John Huss, William Tyndale, and many more, that stood up against the Roman Catholic oppression of the 14/15th century. But now these are all names long forgotten by the Protestant world today. How sad it is because you see, if you forget your roots, your biblical heritage and culture, then you forget who you are. You are Christ's, his servant, so why follow another master?'</p>
                            <p>Remember, Jesus came and founded the true, remnant religion (Christianity), amidst a Babylonian-like, religio-political system (The Jewish Nation's leaders who intermingled with Roman politics to keep the power in Jesus' time). That's the difference between Babylon and the Remnant, that defining line is the Protestant movement's pillar beliefs, the five Solas. </p>
                            <p>I, like my Master, love others. I wish to draw them nearer to Christ. For me, the goal is to arouse the conscience to ponder on the relationship with Jesus. My agenda is Christ's Kingdom, my mission to preach it. We know there are two banners, that of Christ and that of Satan. Because Christ offers us life eternal Satan will try and keep us from accepting it, or at the very least, make us ignorant of the Mode by which we are to obtain life eternal.</p>
                            <p>Back to the Reformers. <a href="https://m.egwwritings.org/en/book/132.646#646" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Martin Luther</a> is one of the most renown reformers. He nailed the 95 theses against Roman Catholicism to the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg, Germany. That one act kindled the great Protestant Reformation and also the fury of Roman Catholicism, why?</p>

                            <blockquote>Luther called the
                                <a href="https://m.egwwritings.org/en/book/132.526#619" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Papacy</a> the
                                <a href="https://m.egwwritings.org/en/book/132.526#631" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">antichrist</a>
                                 power because of their heretical teachings and misrepresentation of Jesus Christ and the Bible.</blockquote>

                            <p>Luther was threatened multiple times by burning at the stake, but his faith never wavered and he fought the good war and ran the good race for his Maker and Friend, Jesus Christ.</p>
                            <blockquote>Thus the Reformed Protestant faith spread throughout the entire known world. And here we are today, you and I. We the protestants that are protesting something, and we have no idea what it even is we are protesting against!</blockquote>
                            <p>We are protesting against the heresies that Rome is preaching today, the same heresies as in Luther's day, over 500 years ago. We are protesting against the traditions of men being held at the same authority as the Holy Bible. We are protesting against the false worship of God, the worship of idols. We are protesting against the misinterpretation of Bible prophecy as presented to us by Rome. We are protesting against salvation by works, against righteousness obtained by ritual. Against suppression of the truth, against the usurpation of Christ's doctrine for the doctrine of men.</p>
                            <p><strong>Go read Matthew chapter 15:1-20</strong>, the <strong>parallel chapter is Mark 7:1-23</strong>.</p>
                            <p>Back to Luther and his death. Luther's disciple, and friend, Melanchthon continued the work, and the Reformation spread to Germany, Switzerland, England, Ireland, France, and throughout the entire known world. This is the kind of dedication, devotion, love and grace that the Word of God inspired in its believers. The Reformers were all willing to seal their faith by their blood, by the grace and mercies of God, and they all did. Are we willing to do the same?</p>
                            <p>You see, Jesus said that His faithful flock will share in His life, death and persecution. These Solas are there to equip the faithful for the service of Christ.</p>

                                        <em>Sola Fide</em>, <strong>saved by Faith alone</strong>. What a powerful truth and liberating thought.
                                        There is nothing that we can do under the sun to earn our salvation,
                                        but this does not mean that once saved, we are always saved.
                                        We are called to continually work out our salvation in the sight of God;

                                        How wonderful to know that God's grace is sufficient for us.
                                        It enables us to labour for Christ and our fellowmen.
                                        It is the fuel by which we run the good race.
                                        It enables us to take hold of the precious promises He gave us;

                            <p>You see, we are the chosen of God. His elect people, His peculiar nation, but we are to beware of the false prophets and heretical teachers. How can we do that if we do not have a sound and stable foundation? Jesus taught a parable that explains this situation, his very last parable to conclude one of the greatest sermons of the entire Bible. The Sermon on the Mount, Matthew 5-7.</p>
                            <blockquote>
                                “Therefore whoever hears these sayings of Mine,
                                <strong>and does them, I will liken him to a wise man</strong> who built his house on the rock:
                                and the rain descended, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house;
                                and it did not fall, for it was founded on the rock. But everyone who hears these sayings of Mine,
                                <strong>and does not do them, will be like a foolish</strong> man who built his house on the sand: and the rain descended,
                                the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house; and it fell. And great was its fall.” - Matthew 7:24-27 NKJV
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>
                                We are to search out the Scriptures because it is They who testify of Jesus. We are to study the Scriptures daily and test every form of thought or doctrine against the written Word of God before accepting it,
                                <strong>Acts 17:11</strong>. If we don't do this then we will not be able to discern between the lies of Babylon and the pure milk of the Word.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We are to heed the sound teaching of the Bible, then we will be likened to a wise man who builds his house on the rock. That rock is the Rock of Ages, Jesus Christ.
                                Take note, heed what the <strong>Bible</strong> says and not men. This includes you, dear reader, you are called to take what I say, and what you read, and test it with the Scripture.
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>We are to live by grace, through faith, in Christ Jesus alone. Praising and Glorifying God, not man, and being firmly rooted in Scripture.</blockquote>
                            <p>This is what true, practical, Christianity <strong>MUST</strong> look like. The Protestant Reformers died for the truth so that we can be free from the Romish yoke imposed on the Christian faith during the Dark Ages.</p>
                            <p>Now is the time for the Five Solas to be lived out. Now is the time for the Three Angels Message to fly throughout the world and be preached. Jesus is coming soon. Be prepared beloved, return to your Biblical roots. Turn to Jesus and the true God of the Bible, not God as antichrist has portrayed Him by their false traditions and theologies.</p>
                            <p>Be warned;</p>
                            <blockquote>"The coming of the lawless one is according to the working of Satan, with all power, signs, and lying wonders, and with all unrighteous deception among those who perish, because they did not receive the love of the truth, that they might be saved. And for this reason God will send them strong delusion, that they should believe the lie, that they all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness." - 2 Thessalonians 2:9-12</blockquote>
                            <p>But be comforted;</p>
                            <blockquote>"In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins. We love Him because He first loved us." - 1 John 4:10, 19</blockquote>
                            <blockquote>"For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments. And His commandments are not burdensome. If you love Me, keep My commandments." 1 John 5:3, John 14:15</blockquote>
                            <p>May Christ be your centre and your only foundation as you diligently seek His truth and His Holy Spirit.</p>
