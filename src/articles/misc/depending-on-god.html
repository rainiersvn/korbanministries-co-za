                    <br/>
                    <p>Scripture says a lot about a diverse range of topics, too much actually. We can spend a lifetime searching for truth in Scripture and then still not be able to understand the what, how, and why of it all. One thing is certain, however, when the great 
                        "<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%203%3A14&version=NKJV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I AM WHO I AM</a> 
                        speaks then we should listen, God doesn't suggest. He declares.</p>
                        <blockquote>"Declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times the things that are not yet done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure" - Isaiah 46:10; 41:26 - NKJV</blockquote>
                    <p>God can, and does, declare to us His will and good pleasure. He declares His love and compassion towards us. He pronounces His unconditional favour and grace to all who would accept Him, and His Son as Saviour. We can rest assured that our God doesn't go back on His word, nor does He change from one day to the next. Remember; "God is love" - 1 John 4:7</p>
                    <p>Jesus asks, exhorts, and commands obedience to Himself, and the Father, alone. Christ doesn't command this from a dictatorial viewpoint, but rather from a servant's perspective. He has been serving His Father in total faith and love. Likewise, the Father has showered the Son with absolute fidelity, grace, and love. Jesus wants us to share in this wonderful relationship of total overwhelming grace and love with them.</p>
                    <p>This truth of a love-relation with the Son, and Father, is so contrary to the methodology of this age, which is; self-empowerment and self-sufficiency at the cost of others. Let us examine this most profound truth;</p>
                    <blockquote>"Do you not know that to whom you present yourselves slaves to obey, you are that one’s slaves whom you obey, whether of sin leading to death, or of obedience leading to righteousness?" - Romans 6:16 NKJV</blockquote>
                    <p>Please bear with me for the next few sections, it gets intense but it gets important. The serving of sin and being obedient to God are not new principles. God's Holy precepts, the Ten Commandments, contains valuable, deep insights and a profound principle. Let us take a look at what the great I AM has to say;</p>
                    <blockquote>"I am the Lord your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery." - Deuteronomy 5:6 AMP</blockquote>
                    <p>Two key points here;</p>
                    <ol>
						<li>God is sovereign, HE delivered Israel from slavery.</li>
						<li>The Lord IS God, the God of Israel and the God of our hearts today.</li>
					</ol>
                    <p>Let us continue;</p>
                    <blockquote>"You shall remember [with thoughtful concern] that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and that the Lord your God brought you out of there with a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm; therefore the Lord your God has commanded you to observe the Sabbath day." - Deuteronomy 5:15 AMP</blockquote>
                    <p>Yes, that's right, the Sabbath. For too many, it might be a sensitive topic to converse about, but it is a beautiful one. Let us think about this verse a bit. I will list some key points for consideration:</p>
                    <ol>
						<li>Israel to remember that they were slaves.</li>
						<li>They were delivered from slavery, but not by their power.</li>
						<li>God commands them to remember the Sabbath. [see verse 14]</li>
					</ol>
                    <p>Why must they remember that they were slaves in Egypt? Why should they keep in mind that God delivered them, and they were powerless to do so themselves? What on earth does the remembrance of the Sabbath has to do with all of this?</p>
                    <p>We are of Abraham's seed, and thus we inherit the unbreakable covenant, the eternal inheritance.</p>
                    <blockquote>"Brethren, I speak in the manner of men: Though it is only a man’s covenant, yet if it is confirmed, no one annuls or adds to it." - Galatians 3:15 NKJV</blockquote>
                    <blockquote>"Now the promises [in the covenants] were decreed to Abraham and to his seed. God does not say, “And to seeds (descendants, heirs),” as if [referring] to many [persons], but as to one, “And to your Seed,” who is [none other than] Christ." - Galatians 3:16 AMP</blockquote>
                    <p>We, like Israel of old, have been set free from slavery and sin. We are to remember that we have been delivered, not by our power, but by the power of the Holy Spirit. Finally, we are to remember the Lord and what He has done, remember, lest we forget Him and His ways.</p>
                    <p>You see, remembering the Sabbath is to remind us whom we serve, a way-maker, chain-breaker, miracle-working, and covenant-keep God. Not legalism, humble dependence. Not ignorance, but rather remembrance. Not rebellion, but loyalty to God. Not my will, Thy will. His will is that we all walk as His Son walks. Humbly, meekly dependant of the Father in all things;</p>
                    <blockquote>"Now by this we know that we know Him, if we keep His commandments. He who says, “I know Him,” and does not keep His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. But whoever keeps His word, truly the love of God is perfected in him. By this we know that we are in Him. He who says he abides in Him ought himself also to walk just as He walked." - 1 John 2:3-6 NJKV</blockquote>
                    <p>Let us not make the same rebellious mistakes like Israel of old. Let us come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace in our times of need. With humility and meekness believing that He who sits on the throne is the rewarder of those that diligently seek Him.</p>
                    <p>Be dependant on God to show you the way, pray for His will in your life. If you, with a pure heart, ask to know God's will and are willing to lay down yours then the Lord will answer you;</p>
                    <blockquote>"Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free" - John 8:32 KJV</blockquote>
                    <p>May Jesus bless you richly as you ponder this great truth as found in Christ alone.</p>
