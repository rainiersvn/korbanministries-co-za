                    <p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=worldview&oq=worldview&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5j46j69i60.1416j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Worldviews</a>, 
                        the one word that has been captivating my thoughts for a while now. The broadest defining category of how we perceive and interpret life; 
                        essentially defining us. It's the lens through which we view the world, ourselves, others, and even God. a Small extract of the definition is as follows:
                    <p>
					<blockquote>"One's worldview is also referred to as one's philosophy, philosophy of life, mindset, outlook on life, a formula for life, ideology, faith, or even religion."</blockquote>
					<p>That's a mouthful of meaning in such a little word, yet it has far-reaching impacts. It affects our whole being. Five basic worldview categories that can be defined, namely;</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Naturalism (the atheist worldview)</li>
						<li>Pantheism (the god-in-all-as-all worldview)</li>
						<li>Deterministic Theism (the control worldview)</li>
						<li>Appeasement Theism (the merit worldview)</li>
						<li>Benevolent Theism (the relational worldview)</li>
					</ol>
					<p>All of us harbour at least one of these worldviews, maybe even multiple ones. What's my point? Let me ask you this, how do you view God, read the following two Scriptures, and ponder it for a moment. Which Scripture reference best depicts your true feeling, belief, and view of God;</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Revelation 14:10 - “He also will drink the wine of God’s wrath, poured full strength into the cup of his anger, and he will be tormented with fire and sulphur"</li>
						<li>1 John 4:7.8 - "Dear friends, let us love one another, for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love."</li>
					</ul>
                    <blockquote>Is God a vindictive, vengeful, and harsh taskmaster in your eyes, or a loving, caring, and generous Father? Do you fear Him or love Him?</blockquote>
					<p>In the 21st century, it is so easy to see God as a distant personage in our daily struggles of life, yet Christ was 
						<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-15.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tempted in like manner as men</a>
						and can, therefore, sympathise with us. We too easily see God through the lens of appeasement theism, that is, to try and appease His anger and earn His favour, which we cannot do because His favour is freely given.</p>
					<p>We try and promise ourselves into His good favour. We try to pray ourselves into His good Salvation. We try to punish ourselves out of habitual sin. We try to play God by being the potters of our own clay lump instead of letting God be God and mould us. We need not lean on our own, fallible, merits.</p>
                    <blockquote>We keep forgetting that we serve El Shaddai, God Almighty. He is more than able to fix us, heal us, and form us in His perfect image.</blockquote>
					<p>Any form of a worldview that does damage to the personage of God that we cling to will ultimately lead to us sinning against God, that is, we become self-dependant. The only eligible and viable worldview that we should harbour is that of benevolence theism, a love relationship with the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. The view in which God is rightly portrayed. The express image of love incomprehensible. This is who God is. Love.</p>
					<p>This brings to remembrance something profound that the Apostle Paul brings to the table in Romans the 8th chapter, this is most significant in helping us to shift our worldview to a view that is filled with God's benevolence;</p>
                    <blockquote>“For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God. For you did not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out, 'Abba, Father.'” - Romans 8:15</blockquote>
					<p>You see, we are called by the Father to be led by the Spirit into accepting Jesus as our Saviour and brother. God is a Father, not a tyrant.</p>
                    <blockquote>"Just as a father loves his children, So the Lord loves those who fear and worship Him [with awe-filled respect and deepest reverence]." - Psalm 103:13 AMP</blockquote>
					<p>Let us, therefore, come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need. Let us turn to the LORD for the forgiveness of sins un-confessed, the healing of broken hearts and broken people, the salvation of our souls! May Christ Jesus bless you all richly as you pray to the Father in Jesus' name for divine guidance in your Christian walk.</p>
