					<p>As the title implies, loving the truth is like loving good food, it is providence to the soul. This is not the fattening, gluttonous junk food of the 21st century, no. I am talking about the healthful, wholesome, nutritious, and appetizing food that vitalizes the soul with fresh vigour! </p>
					<p>Before you ask, yes, food like that does exist. It's called vegetarian/vegan don't hate on a brother for siding with the animal lovers for once, there is a point to this analogy. The point here is that loving the truth, just like tasty healthy food, brings healing and vigor both spiritually, mentally, and physically.</p>
					<blockquote>In 2 Thessalonians 2:9-10 Paul expounds to us what will happen with believers in the end times, how they will forsake the love of the Truth, and delight in wrongdoing.</blockquote>
					<p>We are warned to not forsake our love of the Truth, lest we accept the delusional lies that come with hard-hearted obstinacy. God withdraws His Holy Spirit from all who refuse to accept the light that He impresses upon their minds through the Holy Spirit, essentially handing them over to their vices. We are to guard against this state of having an obstinate heart.</p>
                    <p>God is not partial with His commands. The Decalogue isn't ten suggestions, they are ten commands. Likewise, Jesus' Sermon on the Mount, the Beatitudes, aren't suggestions, they are declarations. God, Christ, and the Holy Spirit are the same yesterday, today, and tomorrow. It is us, the frail ones, that change from day to day, from yesterday until tomorrow.</p>
                    <blockquote>The man of God is to be furnished with good works, 2 Timothy 3:16-17, out of an obedient heart towards all of God's requirements, both those you willingly want to accept and those you reluctantly need to accept.</blockquote>
                    <p>Friends, family, let us meditate on the Truth, "the way, the truth, and the life" (John 14:6), that is Christ Jesus and on Him only. Forsaking the world and clinging to the love of the Truth alone as if to our own lives that we regard as wretched but to obtain, and proclaim, Christ risen and Christ victorious! (Acts 20:24)</p>
                    <blockquote><em>
                        "Beloved, let us love one another, for love is of God; and everyone who loves is born of God and knows God. He who does not love does not know God, for God is love."
                    </em> - 1 John 4:7-8</blockquote>
                    <p>May you all be richly and extraordinarily blessed as you ponder on this great and magnificent truth!</p>
